# eggNotch | Hide your notch the right way

### For Jailbroken devices on iOS 11?-13
### Available on BigBoss, beta versions available on [my repo](https://crkatri.github.io)


Uses overlays to "hide" the notch by effectively creating a fake "software bezel" around the notch of the iPhone X. Because of the OLED screen, it's also virtually unnoticable.
